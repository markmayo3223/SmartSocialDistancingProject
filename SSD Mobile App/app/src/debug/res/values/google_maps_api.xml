    <!--
             The API key for Google Maps-based APIs is defined as a string resource.
             (See the file "res/values/google_maps_api.xml").
             Note that the API key is linked to the encryption key used to sign the APK.
             You need a different API key for each encryption key, including the release key that is used to
             sign the APK for publishing.
             You can define the keys for the debug and release targets in src/debug/ and src/release/.
        -->

    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=C3:64:15:B0:EA:2D:A3:02:D0:27:C9:95:1B:E7:D5:5A:11:12:A8:C2%3Bcom.uccpe.fac19

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    com.uccpe.fac19

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    C3:64:15:B0:EA:2D:A3:02:D0:27:C9:95:1B:E7:D5:5A:11:12:A8:C2

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
